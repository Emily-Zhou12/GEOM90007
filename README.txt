***The platform "City of Melbourne" is mainly developed using the Shiny App in RStudio and it is integrated with visualizations from Tableau.***
***To Execute the program, open "City of Melbourne.R" in RStudio and run the Shiny application.***

When the application is executed, an UI in a web page is run by your preferred browser.

This is an informative dashboard displaying locations in a map, followed by a series of visual analysis designed to enhance the 
tourists experience in Melbourne. On the left, there is a foldable side bar.

At the top of the side bar, there are two essential filters allowing the users to switch between different points of interest
and public transport systems.

Beneath the two filters, there is a small dialog keeps the users informed of real-time weather and temperature.

The main section on the right is an interactive map of Melbourne city and its surrounding areas are marked by categories selected from the filters.

The user could click on the black logos, a tooltip and more information regarding a specific place would pop up.

In the second section below the map, there is a series of graphical visualizations imported from tableau.

This section is scrollable. Annotations and tooltips are used to help the users identify more related patterns in addition to the main map.
