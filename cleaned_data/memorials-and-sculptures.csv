On returning to Victoria some months later, he found John Pascoe Fawkner had already settled the site of Melbourne. With his health declining, he settled on Batman's Hill, near the present site of the Southern Cross Railway Station. He died of syphilis just four years later in 1839.  Batman was buried in the old Melbourne cemetery (since 1922 the Queen Victorian Market), but no headstone marked his grave. When interest in Batman arose 40 years later it was near impossible to establish his burial place. Once found, a bluestone monument was erected in his memory. In 1922, the cemetery was de-registered and the monument moved to the north bank of the Yarra at Swan Street Bridge.

Consequently, the following year it was moved to its current and safer location outside the Town Hall. Prior to the mid-1960s, the fountain's drinking spout was replaced with a modern Danks `bubbler', but in 2001 a duplicate of the original was created ' including the small figure of a kangaroo ' based on MacFarlane's original drawings and on moulds from similar fountains.

The link between the artefact and its emergence is nicely captured in this fountain, erected in memory of the former postmaster-general, Samuel Mauger. Mauger was a passionate advocate for social justice. He formed the Anti-Sweating Labour League of Victoria, was a ceaseless advocate for humanitarian legislation, was involved in the temperance movement and served as president of the Total Abstinence Society. He was also a foundation member of the Melbourne Metropolitan Fire Brigade Board, and for many years served as a volunteer fire fighter.

Water is sprayed from the top and from surrounding ornaments into a large basin. But this scene of innocence was created in a far less naive setting.   Stanford was apprenticed to a London stonemason before coming to Australia to try his luck on the Bendigo goldfields. When he failed to make his fortune, he turned to horse stealing, and in 1854 was imprisoned for 10 years. He was released after six on ticket-of-leave, but was soon found guilty on two charges of highway robbery and another of horse stealing. The sentences amounted to a total of 22 years, two of which were served as hard labour in irons after Stanford broke out of a supposedly `escape-proof' gaol in 1861. In Melbourne's Pentridge Prison, Stanford's talent for drawing and carving was recognised ' he carved bones left over from stews ' and the prison governor allowed him to turn his hand to carving stone. Local sculptor Charles Summers tutored Stanford, who soon set to carving a fountain from bluestone from the prison quarry, which was the only material available to him. He modelled the fountain's avian adornments on a stuffed eagle-hawk and modelled the boy on the governor's son.     The fountain was installed in Carpentaria Place (now known as Gordon Reserve) in 1871, following Stanford's release after he and his friends petitioned for this on the grounds of his ill health. The Illustrated Australian News claimed the fountain was `not only a work of great beauty but ... executed under circumstances of extreme difficulty [which for] most men would have been insurmountable'. Stanford received no payment for the fountain but in time became a respected citizen; he established a business in Windsor, which had a reputation for creating fine headstones. Stanford died in 1880 from `stonemasons' disease', having inhaled a surfeit of fine dust while creating his beautiful fountain.

A cement larger than life-size figure of a man, holding aloft a fully opened clam shell shaped fountain. The figure is atop a large rockery.   While Summers was the sculptor of this larger than life-size statue, which holds aloft an opened clamshell-shaped fountain, it was created in collaboration with Clement Hodgkinson. Born in England in 1818, Hodgkinson trained as a civil engineer before coming to Australia. A talented and diligent man, he joined Melbourne's Survey Office as a temporary draftsman and rose rapidly through the ranks to become deputy surveyor-general in 1858 and assistant commissioner for Crown Lands & Survey in 1861. Described in the Illustrated Melbourne Post as `that most tasteful of amateur gardeners', he was responsible for the development of the Fitzroy, Flagstaff and Treasury Gardens. Hodgkinson was also instrumental developing the Yan Yean project, a reticulated water supply that was essential for the growing city and which allowed its gardens to exist on the scale they did. Based on works by Italian sculptors of the Renaissance, River God celebrated this permanent water supply for Melbourne.   In 1956, council proposed replacing River God; it was in poor condition and 19th-century sculpture was thought to be old fashioned, despite the fountain's historical significance. In 1962, it was replaced with Robin Boyd's Fountain of the Birds. Some three decades later, River God was discovered in a council depot. In 1996, it was conserved and returned not to its original position between Gipps and Hotham Streets, but to above a newly created rockery at the Eades Street entrance.

It comprises around 100 aquatic birds and animals, such as dolphins, crabs and seahorses, sculpted in bronze and fastened to a small pyramid of granite boulders over which water cascades. Some in the community questioned just where the fountain should be located, while others questioned whether it had a place in the gardens at all. One advisor from the National Trust provocatively asked: `Why must the Fitzroy Gardens continue to be the collecting yard of everybody's fantasies?'  Following a period of consultation between the artist, Melbourne City Council and Fountains Trust, it was agreed that the fountain would be sited on the relatively secluded northern bank of the ornamental lake, rather than on the proposed site on Albert Street, where it would be far more prominent. It was unveiled in December 1982.  Many of the fountain's critics have found it at odds with the planned naturalism of the heritage-listed Fitzroy Gardens, but just as Arnold predicted it has been a favourite with children ever since its installation.

Manufactured by Garnkirk, the fountain is of a simple design comprising three tazza bowls of diminishing sizes, with each bowl raised on a socle and pedestal. The rim of each bowl is decorated with an egg-and-dart moulding. The fountain is set on a volcanic rock outcrop within a pool. It is a well preserved example of an imported English design, indicative of the taste in garden ornamentation in the mid-late 19th Century.  Its construction commenced in 1863 under the direction of Clement Hodgkinson, the assistant commissioner of the Survey Office. The original concept incorporated a pool 30.5 metres long, with a central cluster of rocks from which water was to be ejected to nearly 15.25 metres, although this appears not to have been realised. The pond was filled with small islands of aquatic plantings and Sydney Couch Grass.  In 1968, Melbourne City Council wanted to replace the fountain with an elaborate sundial to commemorate the recently deceased prime minister, Harold Holt. When the council's intention became known, some 800 people petitioned against the fountain's removal. In the face of such opposition, plans for the sundial were scrapped and the Grey Street Fountain retained. The fountain is the only surviving ornament from that period in its original position in Fitzroy Gardens.

Robertson was a successful businessman and a philanthropist, making his money and name in confectionery; he was responsible for introducing chewing gum and fairy floss into Australia. Robertson gave to many causes and expeditions, Sir Douglas Mawson even naming Mac Robertson Land in Antarctica in his honour. In celebration of Victoria's centenary, Robertson donated £15,000 as first prize in the Centenary Air Race from London to Melbourne and £100,000 for works to be undertaken around the city. The fountain, unveiled in 1934, is one result of this donation.  Montford migrated to Australia in 1921 and taught at the Gordon Institute, Geelong. He was also president of the Victorian Artists from 1930 to 1931.  He was responsible for a number of sculptural commissions throughout Melbourne, including Justice George Higinbotham, Adam Lindsay Gordon, John Wesley and a series of granite buttress groups for the Shrine of Remembrance.

Above this ledge dance four boys hand in hand representing commerce, industry, science and arts, symbolic designs being shown over their heads.  Above the dancers is a second ledge which is embellished with flowers and birds indigenous to Victoria.  This design is domed by a further ledge surmounted by a boy bearing a basket of fishes on his head. It is constructed from Portland Cement on a frame of stone and iron.  The colossal fountain stands some 10 metres high on the south side of the Royal Exhibition Building, outside the Great Hall. It was constructed for the first of Melbourne's two grand international world fairs. The fountain's visual elements were designed to display the young colony's confidence and advancement, simultaneously signalling the purpose of world fairs to display the produce and industry of nations. At the central level of the fountain, four youths (representing a young and vibrant colony) dance below symbols of the arts, science, commerce and industry; for example, musical instruments, a telescope, sailing ship, steam engine and globe of the world. Above this are images of Victoria's indigenous flora and fauna, and a boy with a clamshell. Holding all of this aloft are four merpeople rising up from the waters of the lower pool. Built during Victoria's boom years, the fountain's spouting water, it was thought, would demonstrate the power and success of the recently established Yan Yean project, which brought potable water to the city. On opening day, however, the pressure was too poor to affect much more than a spurt from the apex of the grand edifice.   In 1994, Hochgurtel's fountain underwent major restoration. It remains a great reminder of the glorious days of Marvellous Melbourne.

It has been conceived as a place of comfort, the seating offering a place for quiet contemplation. The memorial's centrepiece is a low concrete platform in which two rectangular pools are sunk. These house 91 jets, representing the Australians who perished in the bombing; the names of the 22 Victorians killed are recorded on the sides of the fountain. The fountain's 202 lights represent all who died that night. A plaque on the eastern side of the memorial lists the names of the Australians who lost their lives. On each anniversary of the bombing, the fountain recedes to become a reflection pool.  This memorial rejuvenated an existing water feature, built on the site in the 1960s. In 1961, the Melbourne City Council began work landscaping Lincoln Square, laying paths, stone terraces, flower beds and installing an ornamental spraying fountain. It was officially opened by Councillor Brens, Chairman of the Parks and Gardens Committee on the 23rd of July, 1965. The fountain was the first work to be designed financed and installed entirely by the Melbourne City Council, at a cost of 18,000 pounds. The City Architects designed a 40 foot square pool with 150 jets forming the water sculpture. The pool is capped with Sicilian marble and Harcourt granite.

This formal, symmetrical garden is traversed by a watercourse in the shape of a cross, which flows into a grotto carved into the cutting. Built into the grotto is a half-cupola lined with blue tiles, under which stands the small bronze statue of a woman by the sculptor Charles Web Gilbert. The garden was built by the Public Works Department.  In 1933, the Victorian government formed an all-male Centenary Celebrations Council in preparation for Melbourne's centenary the following year. The Women's Centenary Council was formed in an attempt to give the women of the state an influential role in the celebrations. At its first meeting, this council pledged to erect a suitable memorial to Victoria's pioneer women, and fundraising initiatives were established with the aim of developing a garden of remembrance in Kings Domain. The council's initiatives included the sale of a commemorative book and `sheets of remembrance' onto which anyone, for one shilling, could inscribe their own name, or that of an ancestor. This was very successful and thousands of names were gathered and then buried beneath the sundial in the garden. The work was carried out under the auspices of the Unemployment Relief Program during the Depression.   In November 1934, Victorian premier Thomas Argyle dedicated the garden, and in June 1935, Lady Huntingfield and the president of Women's Centenary Council, Mrs I.H. Moss, unveiled two bronze plaques.

In heroic style, the general stands over a shattered cannon, presumably to symbolise his ultimate triumph over the trials and tribulations of military victory and defeat. Four bronze bas-reliefs feature on the limestone base, each depicting one of four key stages in Gordon's life: his victories in China, his charitable activities in Gravesend, his governorship in Sudan and his death in Khartoum. In part, the inscription reads: `I have tried to do my duty / This is the happy warrior ' this is he that every man in arms should wish to be'.    Gordon, the `Great Christian General', was one of the most popular Englishmen of his day, and his reputation was forged on the battlefield and through his Christian activities at Gravesend. During his appointment as secretary to the viceroy of India in 1880, Gordon became unpopular with the government of the day for passionately campaigning for native rule in countries such as Botswana, South Africa and Ireland. Gordon met his death 1885, when as governor-general of the Sudan he refused to evacuate Egyptian forces from Khartoum, believing this to be unsafe.   Gordon's death was mourned throughout the British Empire. So great was the Australian public's response that a fund to produce a copy of Thornycroft's London monument for Melbourne was heavily oversubscribed. Perhaps due to oversubscription, Thornycroft produced the four reliefs for the limestone base, which are not found on the London statue. Although Gordon did not set foot on Australian soil, the monument is of great historical importance; his death prompted the dispatch of the first Australian troops overseas, a regiment from NSW. The statue was unveiled on 26 June 1889.

Bronze inscription on front facade. Oversize 3D bronze statue of Thomas Blamey in uniform standing behind an army vehicle windscreen installed on top of pedestal. The monument was cast in six pieces, four at a foundry in London and two in Melbourne, 1959.  A memorial to Blamey was announced in 1958, although its site opposite the memorial to Sir John Monash had been reserved since 1952. There was some dispute over just what vehicle Blamey would be mounted on, with both tradition and Blamey's wife demanding a horse. Ewers won this battle and mounted his subject on a military Jeep. Sited opposite Monash, depicted on horseback and with whom Blamey had served in World War One, Ewers' statue captures the transformation of the technologies of war through this symbol of its mechanisation. In familiar military style, the plaque is a roll call of Blamey's military positions. Ewers' sculpture is one of the few pieces of traditional memorial statuary created after the 1950s. It represents a change in memorial tradition and, importantly, a decline in monumental figurative sculpture.   Sir Thomas Blamey was born near Wagga in 1884 and was the first Australian to become field marshal. He was a controversial man, who commanded much respect for his actions on the battlefield and for his willingness to challenge British and US generals, but his skills did not translate well to the civilian arena. As police commissioner of Victoria between 1925 and 1936, he was harsh in his treatment of Labor activists and the unemployed, and he resigned amid scandal when he was linked to wounding the superintendent of the Criminal Investigation Bureau. Still, Blamey was knighted in 1935 and promoted to field marshal in 1950, the year before he died.

The column structure is surrounded with bluestone paving slabs with a set of seven step stairs on the west and east side leading down into the parklands.  Bowles' memorial to George V is highly symbolic in design, signalling the power of the monarchy and the British Empire's paternalism towards its colonies. George came to the throne in 1910 and was more a representative of the people than a political sleuth, as had been Elizabeth I and Edward VII. The Empire underwent several changes during his rule: an independent Irish parliament was established in 1918, the country then divided along religious lines two years later, and demands for self-governance in the colonies resulted in the creation of the British Commonwealth of Nations in 1931.   King George V died in 1936. The outbreak of World War Two delayed the construction of Bowles' memorial to him, which was funded by public subscription and by council.

Many were evacuated to Crete with British, New Zealand and Greek soldiers, but here they were defeated in an ill-fated campaign.

Decorated with natural rocks, plants and slate surroundings. An official war artist, Ewers produced many fine memorials in the wake of the war, including the Drouin War Memorial, the Kakoda Memorial in Papua New Guinea and the Sir Thomas Blamey Memorial in Melbourne. Raymond Ewers said of his portrait, ""Different people remember President Kennedy at different periods in his life. I chose to depict him worried and serious as he was shortly before his death.""  Following the 1963 slaying of John F. Kennedy, Ewers was commissioned to cast a bronze portrait of the former US president. This was set in a granite boulder and sited in the tranquil Japanese Gardens within Treasury Gardens. The superintendent of Parks & Gardens and the city architect were responsible for site design and installation, which included remodelling the ornamental lake and building a bridge to the island where the monument would form the centrepiece. A paved area and a bronze flagpole were added, with the intention of reflecting Kennedy's final resting place at Arlington.   John Fitzgerald Kennedy was something of a new breed of US politician. Born to a wealthy family with political pedigree, he was the youngest man ever elected president, and he brought vibrancy to government that gave hope to many Americans. Kennedy was sworn in as president in January 1961, calling his campaign `The New Frontier'. Besides averting a nuclear war with the Soviets over the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, his administration spearheaded many progressive causes. While riding in an open-top limousine through the streets of Dallas, Texas, Kennedy was shot and killed by Lee Harvey Oswald on 22 November 1963.   This memorial is particularly significant for being a rare monument to an American. Memorials to prominent British figures attest to Australia's links with the British Empire, but ours is not a society to commemorate with such solemnity its alliances with the US.

This sits on a rough faced Basalt plinth. The monument is triangular with one face oriented due west, as is common with memorials to lost soldiers. Unveiled 28 May 1904  The Boer War, or South African War, was fought from 1899 to 1902, the British pitted against the Boers (now called Afrikaners). Many opposed Britain's policy, and in Australia many questioned why the nation should be involved. Nevertheless, loyalty to Empire ruled and 16,000 troops were sent, almost a quarter from Victoria. The 5th Victorian Contingent was the largest of eight sent by the state. Some 228 Victorians were killed during the war, which ended with the signing of the Treaty of Vereeniging in May 1902.   Following the return of soldiers, the remaining members of the 5th Victorian Contingent erected this monument to honour their fallen comrades. It is a secular memorial, with traditional funerary symbolism on an elaborate and Gothic scale. Four bronze plaques commemorate the soldiers and in part the text reads: `Unveiled by members of the 5th Victorian Contingent VMR / in memory of their fallen comrades in South Africa 1901'1902 / Honour the brave / King and Empire / Lest we forget / AD 1903'. One face of the monument is oriented due west, as is common with memorials to lost soldiers.   The monument was originally constructed opposite the Victoria Barracks, on St Kilda Road, but was relocated in 1965.

(Source: Official program of the unveiling of the monument, 24th May, 1907)  News of the Queen's death in 1901 saw a wave of public mourning throughout Australia. In Melbourne, a proposal for a memorial was raised with some urgency; Melbourne was thought to have been the only large city in the Empire without a statue honouring the monarch. It was apparently not enough that the state was named after her and the city after her first prime minister. More than £7000 was raised for the memorial through public subscription, and James White was to undertake the commission. There was controversy over the conduct of the committee in selecting White and over his insistence that the marble be sculpted in Italy, rather than in Australia. But on Empire Day 1907 the memorial was unveiled on a raised mound near Linlithgow Avenue in the Queen Victoria Gardens. The lieutenant governor of Victoria, John Madden, unveiled it.  Victoria was born at Kensington Palace in London on May 24, 1819 and crowned Queen on 28 June 1838, when she was just 18 years of age. Lord Melbourne served as her first prime minister, educating her in politics and government. During her reign the British Empire reached its apogee, with vast colonies abroad and great industrial expansion and reforms at home. Notably, it was Victoria that changed the role of the monarchy to a symbolic one, the business of government being left to parliament.",Sculpture,"-37.82184118717754, 144.9724790217425","{""coordinates"":[144.9724790217425,-37.82184118717754],""type"":""Point""}",,Queen Victoria Gardens

Gordon was born in 1833 in the Azores, Portugal, where his maternal grandfather owned a plantation. A wild and impetuous youth, he was sent to South Australia by his family shortly after completing his education in England. Soon after his arrival in 1853 he became a constable in the mounted police, before trying his hand, unsuccessfully, at both politics and running sheep. In much debt, Gordon committed suicide in 1879.  In 1911, a public meeting was held to consider erecting a memorial to Gordon. The first subscription predated this meeting, with the Earl of Dudley donating £60 in 1910. A second meeting, held in 1912, was not well attended and the fund was still £1000 short. It was another two decades before the memorial was finally erected. Montford was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Society of British Sculptors for this work.

Base and obelisk are made of the same Harcourt granite. The base is rough axed, the obelisk is polished. The pediment is made of polished Bethanga granite, in which the inscription is cut. The pediment is surmounted by a rough cut stone section forming a conical transition to the obelisk itself. The top of the obelisk is decorated by a bronze emblem featuring ""888"", on top of which is an encircled globe supporting a crown and orb.  This publicly funded monument was designed to commemorate the eight-hour working day, introduced on 21 April 1856. In February 1856, stonemasons working at the University of Melbourne marched on Parliament House, pressing claims for a regulated eight-hour working day. The skilled workers were in a good position to have their claims met; Melbourne was experiencing a building boom and some of the city's great public buildings, such as the Public Library (now known as the State Library of Victoria), were under construction. After weeks of protest, the workers became the first in the world to achieve a 48-hour working week. The `888' on the top of obelisk refers to the workers' popular slogan: eight hours' work, eight hours' rest and eight hours' recreation. Around the monument's globe the inscription reads: `Labour, Recreation, Peace'. While the eight-hour day was an important achievement for the building workers, conditions for women and child labourers in particular remained unchanged and unreasonable for decades.  The monument was unveiled in 1903 and 14 surviving pioneers of the eight-hour-day movement attended the ceremony. Mr Ward, MLA, claimed in his keynote address that the `pioneers had led the way, not only for Victoria, but for the rest of the world'.   Originally located in Gordon Reserve, Spring Street, the monument was moved to the corner of Russell and Victoria Streets in 1923. Its site near Parliament House was perhaps a spur to reform, although the present site opposite Trades Hall is wholly appropriate.

Both the King and charger are heroically treated and the simple lines of the granite pedestal lend dignity and grace to the statue.  A formal stone alcove on a paved bluestone terrace forms the base of the memorial with two bronze lion heads spouting water into circular pools at each end. Six basalt steps mark the entrance to the memorial.  Mackennal's statue of Edward VII depicts a heroic king in the full dress uniform of a British field marshal. The eldest son of Queen Victoria, Edward was rebellious into his adulthood and the Queen showed her displeasure by denying him any governmental position. Despite his lack of experience, Edward successfully negotiated England's conciliation with France, earning him the title of `the peacemaker', and his social reforms made him popular among his subjects.  The desire to create a monument to Edward in Melbourne took hold immediately following his death in 1910. Mackennal was commissioned to undertake the work on a tender of £1867, but the statue eventually cost three times that price. The outbreak of World War One delayed the statue's production, but casting in London commenced at the war's end. It was unveiled in 1920.

Originally a pointed section was on top, however this has since disappeared.  Flagstaff Gardens once had special significance for the people of Melbourne. It was a place of hope and a place of sorrow. Early colonists could sight incoming ships from this high point, which brought tangible links with the old country; and known as Burial Hill, it was also the city 's first burial ground. This latter role is reflected well in the Gothic architecture of the memorial, for as if wrested from an English church it is a reminder that this final resting place for an estimated six early settlers is a long way from  'home '.   The rapid growth of Melbourne made the site unsuitable as a cemetery, so a new burial ground was established at what is now Queen Victoria Market. Save for two wattle trees, the graves of the first buried went unmarked until 1871. The Department of Public Works then commissioned a sandstone obelisk by Samuel Craven for this purpose, its pointed uppermost section now missing.

In 1992, Elizabeth MacKinnon was commissioned to create a public artwork for the old Newmarket saleyards, transformed into a residential neighbourhood as part of the state government Lynch's Bridge Project. Commissioned at a key juncture in the site's life, the mosaic recollects the saleyards' past and acknowledges its future through its two pictorially distinct parts. The mosaic mural was gifted to the City of Melbourne by the Victorian state government. Before its official unveiling at Epsom Road underpass in 1998, it toured to towns in country Victoria and was displayed at Footscray's Living Museum of the West.   The Epsom Road underpass was known as `the back gate' during the saleyards' 126-year history. The back gate was where all livestock passed following its auction, each beast counted so a fee could be levied for the City Council. It is here that the mural is sited.  During MacKinnon's research for the part known as `In Memory of the Newmarket Saleyards' she consulted with former stockmen and older community members to pay homage to the saleyards and to those whose working lives were structured by it.   MacKinnon worked closely with members of the new Lynch's Bridge community to devise the 12 panels comprising `To the Future'.

The unveiling of The Vault in 1980 in the City Square by contemporary artist Ron Robertson-Swann gave rise to one of the biggest art controversies. His work has often divided critics, but none has been as controversial as Vault.  Dubbed the `Yellow Peril' by Councillor Osborne, the yellow metal sculpture caused a storm of protest over its suitability for City Square. Ironically, it was commissioned for its compatibility with the square's design. The winner of a competition organised by the square's architects, Robertson-Swann's design met the challenge of being a `grand interlocked sculpture'. It also met the requirement of being bold, visually simple and a strong focal point, which would offset the formal character of the square. But while Vault met these objectives, it was a little too abstract for public taste.  Professor Patrick McCaughey gave his full support to the work, applauding it for design excellence. Recognising McCaughey's reputation in visual arts, council approved the plans. When the sculpture was installed it was yet to be named, and despite Robertson-Swann soon naming it Vault, Yellow Peril, with its racist overtones, has stuck.   Following its installation in 1980, Councillor Osborne tabled a survey showing Melburnians' lack of support for the sculpture's prominent position, based on the opinion that it was not sympathetic to the nearby historic St Paul's Cathedral and Town Hall. Council resolved to relocate the work, but not before it was scrawled with graffiti and used as a play structure. Despite the artist's objections, in 1981 Vault was moved to Batman Park, where among other things it served as a shelter for the homeless. In 2002, Vault was unveiled at its new home outside ACCA, where most consider it in keeping with the surrounding built environment.",Sculpture,"-37.82607139191802, 144.96773271682704","{""coordinates"":[144.96773271682704,-37.82607139191802],""type"":""Point""}",,"Malthouse Plaza approximately 33m NW of CitiPower, Electres 4542PR, 75 Dodds Street, Southbank, 3006"

The beautiful text by Maria Tumarkin, engraved in the bluestone paving under the tree, reinforces connections to the library.  The work also nods to Victoria Harbour's past, both pre-colonial, as a place abundant with plant and bird life, and post-colonial, as a working dock.

Born in Bendigo in 1892, Ola Cohn excelled in art from an early age. She studied at Melbourne's Swinburne Technical College before winning a scholarship to study under acclaimed sculptor Henry Moore at London's Royal College of Art. Cohn exhibited widely in Britain and Europe before returning to Australia, where she established a studio in Collins Street in 1931. Cohn's talent and skills were recognised with an OBE, which was awarded to her in 1965 for  services rendered in the service of art, especially sculpture'.  In undertaking the Fairies Tree, Cohn was inspired by Ivor Innes' Elfin Oak, located in Kensington Gardens, London. Commencing work on the Fairies Tree in 1931, Cohn spent three years carving the ancient Red Gum. She suffered the discomfort of weather extremes, stings by mosquitos and bees ' which had made the old tree stump their home ' and repeated acts of vandalism on the work.   Cohn worked in a fittingly organic fashion, using the trunk's natural irregularities to inspire her myriad carvings of Australian and European fairies, dwarfs, gnomes, imps, goblins, elves and animals. Upon completion in May 1934, the tree was gifted to the city's children. Cohn says she carved the tree `mostly for fairies and for those who believe in them'.  In 1977, the trunk was extracted from the ground for chemical treatment and for the removal of rotten wood. Following treatment, it was mounted on a concrete base in an effort to preserve the work. It continues to get regular conservation treatment.",Sculpture,"-37.81340997178163, 144.98110223857506","{""coordinates"":[144.98110223857506,-37.81340997178163],""type"":""Point""}",,"Fitzroy Gardens approximately 34m SW of The Pavilion, Fitzroy Gardens, Wellington Parade, East Melbourne, 3002"

This piece is the work of the French sculptor Robert Delandere, and it was exhibited in the Grande Palais, Paris, where it excited favourable comment.""  Madame Gaston-Saint, an Australian who married a wealthy Frenchman, intended that the statue should be erected in memory of her father in Rheole, a small Victorian fruit growing town. Plans were damaged however, and the statue was presented to the Melbourne City Council in 1933. The Lord Mayor, Councillor Gengoult Smith, and the Chairman of the Parks and Gardens Committee, Alderman Stapley, together with other members of the Council accepted the statue from Madame Gaston-Saint in its current position on 24 April, 1933. They thanked her on behalf of the council and the City. Madame Gaston-Saint asked that the statue be offered ""to honour the sorrow of those mothers whose sons fell in the Great War 1914-1918"". Not everyone was happy with the work. Paul Montford, sculptor of the Peter Pan and Adam Lindsay Gordon statues, wrote to the Lord Mayor on 19 April 1933.

Dramatically represented with powerful shoulders and head twisted to the right, Farnex Hercules is a classical representation of a powerful hero. The bust sits atop two large granite blocks fixed one on top of the other.   Half god, half-human, Hercules was both the most famous hero of ancient times and the most beloved.  Born out of an illicit affair between Zeus and a beautiful mortal woman, Alcmene, Hercules had to bear tremendous hardship at the hand of Hera, wife of Zeus and Queen of the Gods. His is the story of a man so strong and courageous, whose deeds were so mighty, and who so endured all the hardships that were given to him, that when he died, Hercules was brought up to Mount Olympus to live with the gods.  Farnex Hercules was donated to the city by well-known solicitor, politician, newspaper proprietor and educationalist Theodore Fink. He acquired the bust and a replica of the Belvedere Apollo as gifts to the people of Melbourne, when visiting Rome; the works were unveiled in 1928. Fink's donation marked the end of a tradition of placing copies of classical statuary in Melbourne's public gardens, a tradition that took root in the 1860s. Most were removed by the 1930s.  The two busts were unveiled on the 2 October 1928 at the main entry to the Queen Victoria Gardens.  Fink hoped the busts would  'not only beautify our parks but elevate the taste of people and help them to appreciate fine things, stimulate the national love of beauty, that will express itself in the work of Australian sculptors and artists. ' This donation marked the end of a tradition of placing copies of classical statuary in Melbourne 's public gardens.  Since the 1860s the Fitzroy, Flagstaff and Carlton Gardens had been profusely ornamented with casts of sculptures from the National Gallery and elsewhere.  But by Fink 's time these had gone out of fashion and were allowed to deteriorate.  Most were removed by the 1930s.

The work encourages passers-by to walk through it, but the vertical elements also draw the viewer's attention up to the main, netlike component, challenging them to consider its meaning.

Born in Melbourne in 1861, Margaret Baskerville studied painting at Melbourne's National Gallery School and Victorian Academy, and later undertook private lessons with Charles Douglas Richardson. Between 1904 and 1906 she studied sculpture with Edouard Lanteri at the Royal College of Art, London. On her return to Australia, she quickly became the country's most acclaimed woman sculptor and was responsible for a number of major civic memorials in Melbourne and in rural towns, including Sir Thomas Bent (Brighton), and war memorials at Alexandra and Maryborough. One such piece is her marble bust of the English nurse Edith Cavell. This work commemorates a woman whose beneficence delivered her a tragic end, which is depicted on the cast-bronze relief panels on the bust's pedestal.  Edith Cavell trained as nurse in the late 1890s. In 1907, she was posted in Brussels to assist in establishing a modern nursing system at the Berkendael Medical Institute. At the outbreak of World War One she was left in charge of the hospital and what is now known as the Red Cross. During that time she assisted more than 200 Belgian, British and French soldiers who had been separated from their armies, or who had escaped German detention. In 1915, she was accused of conspiring to help prisoners escape, and was tried by a military court in Brussels. She was convicted and sentenced to death, along with four others. Cavell was executed by firing squad on 12 October 1915; she was still wearing her nurse's uniform. Her last words feature on one of the memorial's plaques: `I know now that patriotism is not enough. I must have no hatred and no bitterness towards anyone.' Cavell's body was returned to England in 1919, where a full military service was conducted at Westminster Abbey.  The appeal for funds for a Cavell memorial garnered such support in Australia that much of the money was devoted to assisting incapacitated war nurses. In 1916, the Edith Cavell Trust Fund was officially inaugurated in Victoria; it lasted nearly 60 years, until 1974.

Known as the Greek god of the sun, Apollo would harness four horses to his chariot each day to drive the sun across the sky. In art, the youthful Apollo is traditionally seen as the epitome of beauty, but this god also has associations with music, prophecy and medicine.   Belvedere Apollo was donated to the city by well-known solicitor, politician, newspaper proprietor and educationist Theodore Fink. He acquired the bust and a replica of the Farnex Hercules for the people of Victoria when he was visiting Rome. The works were sited at the main entrance to Queen Victoria Gardens when they were unveiled in 1928; their location was slightly altered when Alexandra Avenue was lowered to pass beneath St Kilda Road. Fink's donation marked the end of a tradition of placing copies of classical statuary in Melbourne's public gardens, a practice that took hold in the 1860s and lasted into the early decades of the 20th century.    The two busts were unveiled on the 2 October 1928 at the main entry to the Queen Victoria Gardens.  Fink hoped the busts would  'not only beautify our parks but elevate the taste of people and help them to appreciate fine things, stimulate the national love of beauty, that will express itself in the work of Australian sculptors and artists.  'This donation marked the end of a tradition of placing copies of classical statuary in Melbourne 's public gardens.  Since the 1860s the Fitzroy, Flagstaff and Carlton Gardens had been profusely ornamented with casts of sculptures from the National Gallery and elsewhere.  But by Fink 's time these had gone out of fashion and were allowed to deteriorate.  Most were removed by the 1930s.

Sir Doug steps forward in conversation and Lady Gladys stands with him. In the bluestone paving below, Ngarra Murray's etching incorporates the totems Bigarrumdja the Emu and Waa the Crow with diamond-shaped markings. These traditional symbols mark her great-grandparents' connection to country. The position of the statue is significant, located between the two key locales of Sir Doug work, Fitzroy and state parliament.  Sir Doug Nicholls was the pastor of Australia's first Aboriginal Church of Christ, in Fitzroy, Melbourne, and in 1957 became a field officer for the Aboriginal Advancement League. His commitment to Indigenous welfare made him a natural representative for Aboriginal people, and he was awarded a MBE for his efforts in 1957. He worked as a lay preacher at the Gore Street Mission Centre from 1935, but he really began working with disadvantaged Aboriginal people in the early 1940s through the Aboriginal Advancement League. In 1968, he was awarded an OBE for his work and became a member of the new Victorian Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs. In 1972, he was the first Aboriginal person to be knighted, and four years later he became the governor of South Australia.  Like her husband, Gladys Nicholls was born at Cummeragunga Aboriginal station in NSW. After the death of her first husband, Howard Nicholls, in 1942, Gladys married his brother Doug. She was committed to working towards the welfare of the underprivileged, as well as for the rights of women. Gladys was a charity worker and fundraiser, and among other achievements became secretary of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Women's Council and the Victorian state president in the 1970s.   Together the Nicholls were prominent campaigners for Indigenous rights and justice, and this memorial statue, first proposed by the Department of Justice and keenly supported by the Nicholls' family, recognises this. It is the first memorial sculpture in Melbourne dedicated to Aboriginal leaders, and its presence strengthens the visibility of Indigenous people and cultural diversity in Melbourne.

Artist statement Standing by Tunnerminnerwait and Maulboyheenner is a permanent marker that is experimental and empowering. It begs contemporary viewers to embrace innovative processes of how to remember their tragic story through historical artistic representations of the ready-made object.   The permanent marker comprises six brightly coloured newspaper stands, a static solid bluestone swing, indigenous food and medicine plantings and a reproduction suburban Victorian style fence.  The brightly coloured newspaper stands represent colours of both the Aboriginal and Australian flags: red, white, blue yellow and black. Australian and Aboriginal law have often clashed and this story is one that represents this clash, hence the colours of the flags coming together. Newspapers in each stand acknowledge diverse early colonial and Aboriginal histories of Melbourne and Tasmania, heritage stories and the specific story of Tunnerminnerwait and Maulboyheener.  The static solid bluestone swing and tomb-like structure with the names Tunnerminnerwait and Maulboyheenner engraved on the side invites visitors to the site to sit, contemplate and reflect.

Sculpture,-37.8202,144.9607,1088260,,Owned,Constellation,1996,City of Melbourne,Arts & Culture Branch,"BARTLETT, Geoffrey; Armstrong, Bruce",Enterprize Park,"During the 19th century, the Yarra River near the corner of Queen and Flinders Streets was the focus of Melbourne's shipping activity. Natural falls in the river created a barrier between the salt and freshwater, and just below the falls a natural widening in the river enabled boats to turn around after unloading at Customs House (now the Immigration Museum).   In 1996, the Yarra Turning Basin Project was launched. This would recreate the historic turning basin, which had since been filled in, and develop a new riverside promenade that would complement and extend the existing spatial design of the river's northern bank. The concept for the site's public artwork entailed a series of five figureheads, which would sit on wooden piers that were integral to the design and material of the timber wharf.  Council's Public Art & Acquisitions Committee selected Bruce Armstrong and Geoffrey Bartlett's design from a short-list of four. Both Armstrong and Bartlett are renowned Melbourne sculptors, each having undertaken many public commissions and having exhibited widely. With the working title `5 figureheads', they crafted Constellation from wood and metal, and using traditional and contemporary approaches to the sculpture's design. The five carved-wood figureheads represent a dragon, woman, bird, man and lion. These evoke a long history of figurehead carving from around the world and also reflect the ethnic and cultural diversity of those who used the turning basin during the early years of settlement. The constructed metal elements suggest maritime forms, lines and images, but they are never simply literal; they require the viewer to engage with the work to read their reference point. The title of this work, too, pays homage to the long history of seafaring, the stars having guided many a vessel from one port to another.   Constellation was unveiled in 1997.",Sculpture,"-37.82024605773942, 144.96066253110223","{""coordinates"":[144.96066253110223,-37.82024605773942],""type"":""Point""}",,"Enterprize Park approximately 54m South of Customs Square, 401 Flinders Street, Melbourne, 3000"

Angela Jane Esdaile was born in Melbourne at St Andrews Hospital on February 19, 1969 and was 24 years old when she died of acute asthma in December 1993, while walking with friends along Rye beach. She was a tireless community worker, who made a significant contribution to the community, particularly with regards to children and young adults. She organised her first community project when she was just 8 years old. Following Angela's death, her family donated funds towards a memorial artwork. In 1994, local artist Loretta Quinn was commissioned to undertake this work, which would commemorate Angela's contribution to the community, as well as those of all childcare workers.

Scar trees are produced by the removal of bark for the purpose of making canoes, coolamons and shields, but also for more sacred purposes, such as to indicate a burial site. Significant cultural artefacts, scar trees are vectors for cultural identity, essential in establishing pre-contact occupation of an area and important in understanding traditional culture and practices.   Sited at Enterprize Park, on the northern bank of the Yarra River just west of Queens Bridge, Scar ' A Stolen Vision is a collaborative work by Indigenous artists that engages with the tradition of tree scarring. The installation symbolises the landscape marked by scar trees, articulating the presence of Indigenous people and their connection to country. The term `scar' links with wounds, healing and memory ' concepts embodied in the work.   Artistic director Kimba Thompson brought together seven visual artists to create contemporary works that convey tradition and underscore continuity with past practices. Karen Casey, Craig Charles, Glenn Romanis, Maree Clarke, Ray Thomas, Ricardo Idagi and Treahna Hamm worked on 30 pier poles recycled from the Docklands project along the Yarra. Carving, burning, painting and reshaping the poles, the artists impart stories relating to their culture, people and history through their own distinctive art practices ' essentially modern forms of tree scarring.   Scar was commissioned by the City of Melbourne as part of Federation events in Victoria, and was co-funded by Arts Victoria and the state government. It was first displayed in City Square in March 2001, at which time it included a soundscape by Lou Bennett and Peter Mumme, which layered the histories and communities of the scar poles with sounds that mimicked their production.

John Kelly's Cow Up a Tree at first seems something of a whimsical work, but the sculpture has its roots in serious historical events. The artist was inspired to create this work after seeing images of cows swept away during terrible flooding in Gippsland; when the floodwaters subsided the carcass of one cow was stranded high and dry in a tree. The work's other inspiration was in Australian artist William Dobell. With the beast's long neck and small head, Cow Up in a Tree is aesthetically linked to Dobell's Archibald Prize-winning portrait of Joshua Smith, a painting enmeshed in an infamous court case during World War II in which `art' was put on trial. But during the war Dobell worked in the area of camouflage, and one of his projects was to produce papier mâché cows to be placed on an airfield in the hope of foiling Japanese pilots. Kelly's sculpture brings these stories together, pondering the fate of Dobell's cows should the Gippsland flood have inundated the airfield.

On the statue is the inscription, ""This is the place for a village.""  Born in Parramatta, New South Wales, in 1801, John Batman is best known as one of Melbourne's founding fathers. The son of a cutler transported for receiving stolen goods, Batman was apprenticed as a blacksmith and later became a farmer. He took up land in North- eastern Tasmania where he prospered and his holdings were further augmented by a government reward for his role in the conciliation of disputes with Indigenous Tasmanians. Looking to expand his grazing land he organised an unofficial expedition to explore Victoria and in May 1835 Batman crossed to the mainland in the Rebecca. In June he was one of an exploring party which walked north from the western end of Port Phillip to near Mount Macedon, then east to Glenburn, and south-west back to the Yarra. Upon finding these lands agreeable he made a controversial treaty with local Wurundjeri Elders, exchanging 20 pairs of blankets, 30 tomahawks, 100 knives, 50 scissors, 30 mirrors, 200 handkerchiefs, 45.4 kg of flour, 6 shirts, 4 jackets and 4 suits, together with an annual rent in the same commodities for 600 000 acres of land along the Bellarine Peninsula. The government of the time soon declared the treaty invalid, claiming the 'Crown' as the true owner of the land. The treaty was also seen to be fraudulent. The signatories were not `chiefs' and the boundaries were not marked. Most importantly, the land belonged to tribes, not individuals, and so was inalienable. An exchange of gifts had been misconstrued as a sale.  Soon after signing the treaty Batman sailed up the Yarra past the present site of Melbourne and made the famous entry in his diary, ""This will be the place for a village.' However, on his return to Victoria some months later he found Fawkner already settled on the present site of Melbourne. With his health declining, Batman settled on Batman's Hill near the present site of the Spencer Street Railway Station and died of syphilis just four years later on the 6 May 1839 at the age of 38.

The philosophy underlying the work is gulpa ngawul, a Yorta Yorta word that most closely translates as `deep listening'. Accordingly, this work by Indigenous artists Vicki Couzens (Kirrae Wurrong/Gunditjmara), Lee Darroch (Yorta Yorta, Mutti Mutti and Trawlwoolway) and Treahna Hamm (Yorta Yorta) honours the traditions of tribes throughout Victoria, particularly those of the Wurundjeri and Boonwurrung, on whose country the city and greater Melbourne is located. Birrarung Wilam listens to and commemorates cultural knowledge, stories and practices, revitalising them through the reinterpretation of tradition and the site.   The central component of the work is the mound campsite, or puulwuurn, supported by an eel pathway, two message sticks, five shields, a group of ancestor stones, interpretative panels, water vessels and an audio installation. The mound campsite is a contemporary recreation of a sitting place, an element central to Aboriginal cultural life; significant artefacts from Aboriginal groups from around Victoria have been interred within the mound. The carved hardwood message sticks stand at the site's eastern and western ends, representing the Wurundjeri/Woiwurrung and Boonwurrung people, respectively, and welcoming visitors onto the site in a gesture of reconciliation. The eel path refers to a primary food source, trapped as they were near the shallow waterfalls that once separated the freshwater river from the salty bay water, not far from this site. The five large metal shields along the riverfront stand in complementary opposition to the feminine form of the mound campsite. On the southern side of the ArtPlay building, etched-metal panels, resembling possum-skin cloaks, interpret each element of Birrarung Wilam and are augmented by a sound installation of Indigenous voices.

For most of its venerable past Speakers Corner has been known as Yarra Bank, a site for political, religious and ideological debate. Between 1890 and the 1960s orators would gather to articulate their views on local and international issues. It was originally a one-hectare, heavily treed area at the western tip of Flinders Park, where orators voiced opinion and dissent from nine bluestone-faced granite mounds (probably built in the 20th century). The site was most attended during periods of upheaval and struggle, such as during World War I, the Depression and the 1940s, when leftist politics were beginning to feel the force of repression. From the 1960s, and with the rise of more varied media, the site has been comparatively quiet, serving as a meeting place for participants following the annual May Day parade.  The construction of the Exhibition Street extension to Batman Avenue in the late 1990s saw changes to Speakers Corner, now integrated into the western point of Birrarung Marr. It was reduced in size to a half hectare, eight of its established trees were removed and three of its mounds were re-sited at the western side of the site. An interpretive sculpture by Evangelos Sakaris has been added, comprising four low-lying, stepped pink-granite outcrops. Inscribed with quotations, these outcrops are spread across the site. The National Speakers Association of Australia was responsible for a commemorative plaque being placed at the site. It honours all those who, throughout history, have informed the public on matters of interest and concern.

It was moved some time later to the conservatory in the Fitzroy Gardens, where the climatic conditions were less than ideal. In 1989, it was placed in storage to await both conservation and a decision on its new home. Jeff Gill, the Alderman's grandson, was instrumental in having the statue returned to a public site.

In 1925, Melbourne City Council's Parks & Gardens Committee allocated funds towards purchasing statues for its public gardens.

Paul Montford's Water Nymph is one of the works purchased. It is a bronze statue of a young woman, with raised arms stroking her hair. She kneels on a round base, which is set in an ornamental lake. This is a classic image of the period. The nymph is linked to age-old representations of the mermaid and the siren, which symbolise female sexuality.

His Diana and the Hounds replaced a cement statue copied from the Roman Diana, Goddess of Mood and Contemplation, held in the Vatican.  The mould was completed in 1939 but the onset of the Second World War temporarily delayed casting by A.B. Brunton in London. The statue was in fact the last to be cast in Britain before the war and had to run the gauntlet of German U-Boats on its return to Australia.

Designed by Neil McLachlan and Anton Hasell in collaboration with Swaney Draper Architects, the installation comprises 39 upturned bells of differing sizes, mounted on poles ranging from two to six metres high. The size of each bell determines its pitch, and collectively the pitch ranges over four octaves.  Most of the bells are harmonic and very pure in their tone; seven are polytonal, so able to play more than one pitch with a single hammer strike. Unlike most modern Western instruments, the bells are `just tuned', a system that follows a harmonic series in nature and means the bells emit a unique sound; music created for the bells must be composed with this system in mind.  Seven Australian composers were commissioned to create pieces of four to five minutes for the launch of the bells. Computer-controlled hammers strike the bells to the tune of the programmed compositions. In 2008, the City of Melbourne launched a website (www.federationbells.com.au) to allow members of the public to compose their own pieces for the bells. By walking among the bells or listening to them from up to 100 metres away, visitors have different aural experiences of the music.

He enlisted to make his way back to England, but as a member of the 3rd Field Ambulance AIA was sent to Gallipoli. After just three weeks of bearing wounded soldiers across Shrapnel Gully on the back of his donkey, Simpson was killed by shrapnel fire.   Simpson's story became a powerful propaganda tool for enlistment in Australia, but following the war he was quickly forgotten. With the Shrine of Remembrance nearing completion in 1933, the memory of Simpson was rekindled to commemorate all who gave their lives to help others during the war. One plaque reads: `The / Man with his donkey / Gallipoli ' / In commemoration / of the valour and compassion / of the Australian soldier'.  In 1935, Wallace Anderson's design for the memorial was selected though a competition organised by the Australian Red Cross.

The ill-fated journey of Burke and Wills is one of the most recited episodes in Australian history, and one that Summers would have a role in memorialising. Burke and Wills' journey began amid glorious public sentiment of hope and pride as their team set off for the Gulf of Carpentaria. Among other things, the publicly funded expedition would help solve the puzzle of what lay in Australia's interior, and at a time of interstate rivalry it would bring triumph to Victoria. But the expedition ended as a sorry tale of rash decision-making and unfortunate timing, and ultimately with the deaths of Burke, Wills and Gray.   On 2 November 1861, news of the death of Burke and Wills reached Melbourne, and within days grief swept the city; more than 40,000 people are said to have paid their last respects to the fallen heroes.

The statue was originally located on the west side of St Kilda Road where Sir John Madden, Lieutenant Governor, unveiled the statue on 23 January 1904. The statue was moved to its current site in the Treasury Gardens in 1970 due to a change in the profile of St Kilda Rd with both the developments of the NGV and the Victorian College of the Arts occurring in the area. The Robert Burns Memorial remains an important symbol of the contribution that Scottish immigrants made to the early development of Victoria; many of the first graziers and squatters in Gippsland and the Western District were of Scottish descent. The memorial is a uniting symbol for the Melbourne 's Scottish community and is an important part of Melbourne 's cultural heritage.  Poet Robert Burns is perhaps one of the most famous characters in Scottish history. His importance is immense, not only in terms of his work, but for his influence on the poetry and culture of Scotland. Robert Burns was born on 25th January 1759, in the tiny village of Alloway, Ayrshire, near Ayr on the West Coast of Scotland. The son of a poor peasant farmer, Burns grew up in abject poverty and was forced labour long hours throughout his childhood.  Despite their poverty Burns ' father recognised the value of education and contracted the services of local teacher, John Murdoch.  From an early age it was apparent that Burns was a gifted scholar, writing his first piece Handsome Nell (a poem about his first love and the first of many odes to women) at the age of 15. Unlucky in love Burns resolved to emigrate to the West Indies, intending to pay for his passage with the proceeds from the publication of his first book, Poems, Chiefly in Scottish Dialect, published in 1786. The publication immediately captured the hearts of the Scottish public and was considered to be one of the greatest collections of poetry ever written. Enjoying his new found celebrity, Burns began to write profusely publishing many poems, among them perhaps his most famous piece Auld Lang Syne. Burns ' appeal was universal; his words resonated with the ruling class, the educated and the common folk alike.  Love and sympathy were his greatest themes and he often paid tribute to the working class in his works. Burns died in extreme poverty of rheumatic fever in 1796 at the age of 37.

A bronze equestrian statue of Marquis of Linlithgow on a granite pedestal. John Adrian Lewis Hope, the Earl of Hopetoun, arrived in Australia to serve as the governor of Victoria from 1889 to 1895. During these years he travelled widely, investigating social conditions and alleviating hardship where he could. He returned to England in 1895, with a reputation for being one of the most conscientious governors in Australia. He returned to Australia in 1901 to become the new federation's first governor-general, but his popularity quickly waned, in part because his expenses were perceived as exorbitant. He resigned from his position a year later and returned to his native Scotland, where he died in 1905. In 1902, the Earl of Hopetoun was made Marquis of Linlithgow.  A handful of anonymous tenders for a commemorative statue to Hope were considered before William Birnie Rhind's design was selected. Lady Linlithgow had requested that her late husband be represented on horseback to show his admiration for these noble beasts. Rhind's moulds were made in Scotland and the bronze was cast in Naples. Governor-General Sir John Fuller and acting Prime Minister William Hughes unveiled the statue in June 1911.

The bronze sculpture sits on a granite plinth. Unveiled 8 November 1925.  The idea for a monument to Matthew Flinders was first discussed in1911 after a meeting of the Royal Geographical Society of Melbourne. In 1915 a public subscriptions began, however with the coming of war the plans were put on hold. In 1922 the notion was resurrected, this time by the Melbourne City Council, and C. Web Gilbert was elected to create the piece. In subsequent months there was much factional fighting and public debate about the location and the form of the sculpture. There was heavy competition for the statue to be placed at the St Kilda foreshore, but a Council meeting decided in 1923 that it ""must be located within the city of Melbourne."" Finally in 1924 a design was approved and permission was granted by St Paul 's Cathedral to house the statue on their grounds. The bronze statue itself was cast in Paris by Barbedienne, and sadly Gilbert died just days before it returned to Melbourne. It was unveiled by the Governor, Lord Stradbroke on November 7 1925, in the presence of more than 3000 people.   Flinders gained acclaim for establishing the strait between mainland Australia and Tasmania in 1798. Over 1801'03, he mapped the coast of Australia, completed against great odds, and was the first cartographer to use `Australia' on maps, rather than `New Holland'. On the Flinders' Statue Fund collecting card, Professor Ernest Scott wrote: `amongst the seamen who habitually traverse these coasts, no name, not even that of Cook, is so deeply esteemed as his'.  Charles Web Gilbert was born in 1867 near Cockatoo, in Victoria. At a young age he became a pastry cook, modelling cake decorations. He later studied at the National Gallery Art School, but had no formal training in sculpture. Gilbert travelled to England at the outbreak of World War One, and shortly after to France, where he made battlefield models for the Australian Imperial Force. Returning to Australia, he worked for the Australian War Memorial, and later undertook many commemorative commissions. The Flinders monument is Gilbert's best known work and has been particularly admired for the use of the boat as the statue's base.",Sculpture,"-37.81696330579109, 144.96748759277108","{""coordinates"":[144.96748759277108,-37.81696330579109],""type"":""Point""}",,"Approximately 38m NE of 13 Swanston Street, Melbourne, 3000"

His father was a transported man and young Fawkner himself ran into some early trouble with the law. However, he made good in Launceston becoming in succession a baker, bookseller, timber merchant, hotelier, authorised court agent for dependents, and newspaper proprietor of the ""Launceston Advertiser"". He organised an expedition to Victoria in August 1835, during which time an altercation took place with Batman s party over land ownership in the Melbourne district. Fawkner built the first house in Melbourne, began the first newspaper (the ""Melbourne Advertiser""), was on the first Legislative Council, and bought a large area of land to be known as Pascoe Vale.

Underneath him is a woman offering a wreath (representing the State of Victoria) and a young man with a scroll (representing education).  Following Clarke's death, a public meeting was held to determine how best to memorialise him. The monument, it was thought, must be `of heroic size' and yet in keeping with Clarke's modesty. Mackennal sculpted the marble in London in consultation with Clarke's son-in-law and with the final approval of Lady Janet Clarke. After much deliberation over a suitable site for the memorial, the entrance to the Fitzroy Gardens was decided upon, and at 4pm on 22 July 1902, it was unveiled by the State Governor, Sir George Sydenam Cole. In presenting the memorial, E.G. Fitz Gibbon declared the memorial was ""rendered to keep the name and worth of Sir William John Clarke green in the memory of the community which he loved so well, and served so nobly.""   William John Clarke was born in Tasmania in 1831 and moved to Victoria in 1860. A philanthropist and wealthy pastoralist, he gave generously to the building funds for St Paul's Cathedral and Trinity College, and supported several other causes. He was actively involved in many areas of public life and was the first Australian to be made baronet. He died in 1897, stepping from a tramcar in Collins Street.   Born in Fitzroy in 1863, Mackennal studied at the Melbourne Model School, King 's College, and the National Gallery.  He travelled to London, Paris and Italy in 1882, before being appointed head of modelling and design at Coalport Potteries in Shropshire in 1886.|He briefly returned to Melbourne to make relief panels for Parliament House, but soon returned to Paris in 1891.  He exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1895 and soon found himself in demand.  Some of his commissions include Queen Victoria (in England, India and Ballarat), the statues of Cardinal Moran and Archbishop Kelly at St Mary 's Cathedral, Sydney, the medal for the London Olympics and several statues around Melbourne including Sir William Clarke and King Edward VII.

Some years later the statue was moved to its present home in Fitzroy Gardens; appropriately, Boy on a Turtle sits in the lower lake of the gardens. In March 1977, this popular statue was stolen from the gardens ' a remarkable feat considering the great weight of the bronze. It was also the fate suffered by Larry LaTrobe nearly 20 years later.
